# dashboardTiles
Bloom Plugin - Displays three tiles across the Dashboard that are clickable.
This is not a standalone piece of code. 
You will need Bloom Platform for this to function. 

To install and run into your version of Bloom, git pull this repo into your plugins folder then run a gulp build process across bloom.
Once Bloom is restarted, your plugins will appear within the admin section of Bloom for you to setup for your users/learners.
